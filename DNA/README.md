# DNABase Class

The `DNABase` class represents a single DNA nucleotide, allowing users to validate and standardize DNA bases. This class provides methods to set and retrieve the base's standard name, ensuring that the base is one of the recognized DNA nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine).

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Validate and standardize DNA nucleotides.
- **Attributes**:
  - `base`: The standard name of the DNA nucleotide.
- **Methods**:
  - `_validate_and_standardize(base)`: Validates and standardizes the input base.
  - `set_base(base)`: Sets the DNA base after validation.
  - `get_base()`: Returns the current DNA base.
  - `__repr__()`: Provides a string representation of the class instance.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `DNABase` class:

```python
from dna_base import DNABase  # Assuming your module is named 'dna_base'

# Initialize a DNABase instance with a valid nucleotide
base1 = DNABase('a')  # Represents adenine
print(base1.base)  # Output: 'adenine'

# Try initializing with an invalid nucleotide
try:
    base2 = DNABase('x')  # 'x' is not a valid DNA base
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: 'x is not a recognized DNA nucleotide'

# Set a new base after validation
base1.set_base('c')  # Changes the base to 'cytosine'
print(base1.base)  # Output: 'cytosine'

# Get the base using the getter method
print(base1.get_base())  # Output: 'cytosine'
