class DNABase:
    """
    A class to represent a single DNA nucleotide.

    This class provides methods to validate and standardize DNA nucleotides, 
    as well as to set and retrieve the base's standard name.

    Attributes:
        base (str): The standard name of the DNA nucleotide.
        
    Methods:
        _validate_and_standardize(base):
            Validates and standardizes a given base to one of the allowed DNA nucleotides.
        
        set_base(base):
            Sets the DNA base after validating it.
            Raises a ValueError if the base is not a recognized DNA nucleotide.
        
        get_base():
            Returns the current DNA base.
        
        __repr__():
            Provides a string representation of the class instance.
