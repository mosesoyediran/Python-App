### Overview
This code snippet provides a class-based structure for handling user roles and permissions. It includes:

- **`Permission`**: A class that defines user permissions (`READ`, `WRITE`, `EXEC`).
- **`BaseUser`**: A base class for managing user permissions and validating user actions based on those permissions.
- **`User`**: A subclass of `BaseUser` that represents a user with a specific role, inheriting the permission-based functionalities.

### Class Descriptions

#### Permission
The `Permission` class defines a set of permissions using the `Flag` class from the `enum` module, allowing for bitwise operations. It includes:
- `READ`: Read permission
- `WRITE`: Write permission
- `EXEC`: Execute permission

These can be combined to create complex permissions (e.g., `Permission.READ | Permission.WRITE`).

#### BaseUser
The `BaseUser` class represents a user with permissions. It contains:
- A dictionary `USER_ROLES` that maps common roles (like `admin`, `user`, `manager`, `support`) to a set of permissions.
- Methods to infer permissions based on a role (`_infer_permission`) and validate permissions for specific operations (`_validate_permission`).

The class provides methods to perform various file-based operations like:
- **`read`**: Reads the content of a specified file. Requires `Permission.READ`.
- **`write`**: Writes specified content to a given file. Requires `Permission.WRITE`.
- **`execute`**: Executes a Python script from a file. Requires `Permission.EXEC`.

If a user lacks the necessary permissions, a `PermissionError` is raised.

#### User
The `User` class inherits from `BaseUser` and represents a user with a specific name and role. It initializes with:
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `user_role`: The role that determines the user's permissions.
- `permissions`: The inferred permissions based on the role.

It has the same functionalities as `BaseUser` and supports bitwise operations to allow flexible permission structures.

### Usage Example
To create an instance of a `User`, you need to provide a name and a role:

```python
admin_user = User("Alice", "admin")  # Creates an admin user with all permissions
user = User("Bob", "user")  # Creates a user with read-only permissions
```

You can then use the `read`, `write`, and `execute` methods to perform operations, validating permissions before execution:

```python
# Read a file
print(admin_user.read("script.py"))

# Write to a file
admin_user.write("script.py", "print('Hello, world!')")

# Execute a script
admin_user.execute("script.py")
```


### Summary
This code snippet is useful for building role-based access control systems in Python applications, providing a flexible and scalable approach to managing user permissions and their associated operations.
